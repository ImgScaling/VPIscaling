Image Scaling by de la Vallée-Poussin Filtered Interpolation

SOFTWARE

The source code of  VPI (de la Vallée-Poussin Interpolation) method, proposed in the paper "Image Scaling by de la Vallée-Poussin Filtered Interpolation", arXiv:2109.13897 (2021), by D. Occorsio, G. Ramella, W. Themistoclakis, is intended by the authors as  support for possible  comparisons. 

The method can be run by the script DemoCall_VPI_supervised.m and DemoCall_VPI_unsupervised.m respectively in supervised nd unsupervised mode. Note that this is an educational code, not optimized.

This material shall not be modified without having permission from the authors.

DATASETS

The validation of the VPI method has been carried out on several kinds of 8-bit color images collected in ten publicly available datasets, having different characteristics on the size and the quality of the images, the variety of the subjects, etc. The employed datasets are synthesized in the following table comprising 1943 images in total.

These datasets are available by the link indicated in the table. The dataset named PEXELS300 has been obtained by selecting 300 images from PEXELS (www.pexels.com/search/color/) that provides a free using and downloading library containing over 3.2 million photos and videos, growing each month by roughly 200,000 files. Its content is uploaded by the users and reviewed manually. The 300 images taken from this dataset, originally with a different large size, have been centrally cropped by 1800x1800 pixels. PEXELS300 is available here with the aim to support the possibility of comparison by other authors.
